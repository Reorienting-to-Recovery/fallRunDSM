# Hatchery Dynamics 

## Existing Approach 

The existing SIT DSMs follow the following model logic for hatchery fish: 

1) Each year there are ___ hatchery adults initiated into the model based on (CWT data?)
2) Percent natural is output from model in the `get_spawning_adults()` submodel     
3) Both natural adults and hatchery adults spawn, all surviving juveniles outmigrate and are carried over to the next year but origin is not tracked.

## Updated Approach 

The updated Recovery life cycle model adds additional hatchery dynamic logic into the model.
1) The first two years there are ___ hatchery adults initiated into the model based on (TODO identify this?). In subsequent years hatchery adults are carried over from prior generations and not initated annually. 
2) Percent natural is output from model in the `get_spawning_adults()` submodel     
3) PHOS initiated as `1 - percent_natural` and adjusted to describe hatchery fish renaturing every 2 generations. Renaturing adjustment assumes that if PHOS is decreasing in 2 prior years than the population of hatchery  for current year should be adjusted by the percent difference of PHOS in current year vs current year minus 2. PHOS is recalculated using adjusted number of hatchery fish divided by total population. 
4) Both natural adults and hatchery adults spawn and fecundity incorporates in an additional parameter describing size of fish (TODO ask rene if he has figured this out)
5) Hatchery releases are added into the model logic as juveniles at chipps island. 
6) All surviving juveniles outmigrate and are carried over to the next year. Hatchery and natural adult returns are tracked separately and have different adult return ratios. 

Detailed overviews of each update including the literature or data source are provided below. 

### Initiating Hatchery Returns 

#TODO - we need number hatch return here 
- discuss best data source with Rene and Alison 

### Calculating Perecnt Natural 


### Calculating PHOS 
#TODO confim okay to initiate as 1 - percent_natural - update via renaturing 
# we can also add habitat constarint (assume natural get to occupy habitat first or something like that)

#### Renaturing 

#TODO review logic with Rene and Alison 

### Fecundity 

#TODO check with rene on fecundity per fish - how would we add in age as a factor her 

### Juvenile Hatchery Releases 

#TODO what data do we want to use here 

### Adult return logic 

# TODO What adult return ratio do we want to use for natural fish, what about hatchery fish? 
# TODO what are the sources for this data?
